Computer programming is important today because so much of our world is automated. 
Humans need to be able to control the interaction between people and machines. 
Since computers and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately, 
we use computer programming to harness that computing power.
This is the first of hopefully many programming courses that can introduce technically inclined people to Python programming.
